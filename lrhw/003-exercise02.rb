#   Exercise 2 : Comments and Pount Characters
#   ------------------------------------------
#   Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you what
#   something does in English,  and they are  used to disable parts of your pro-
#   gram if you need to remove them temporarily. Here is how you use comments in
#   Ruby:


#   A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
#   Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this."     # and the comment after is ignored

#   You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
#   puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

#   From now on, I am going to write code like this.  It is important for you to
#   understand that everything does not have to be literal. Your screen and pro-
#   gram may visually look different, but what is important is the text you type
#   into the file you're writing in your text editor. In fact, I could work with
#   any text editor and the results would be the same.
#
#   The Output of This Program
#   --------------------------
#   $ ruby 003-exercise02.rb
#
#   I could have code like this.
#   This will run.
#
#
#   Also, I am not going to show you  screenshots of all the terminals possible. 
#   You  should  understand that  the preceding is not a  literal translation of 
#   what your output should look like visually.
#
#   Study Drills
#   ------------
#   [1] Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure
#       you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
#   [2] Take your rb file, and review each line going backward.Start at the last
#       line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
#   [3] Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#   [4] Read what you typed  above out loud,  including saying each character by
#       its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
