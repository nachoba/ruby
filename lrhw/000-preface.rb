#   LEARN RUBY THE HARD WAY - 3 EDITION
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Preface
#   -------
#   This book uses a technique called instruction, where I tell  you to do a se-
#   quence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition.
#   This technique works very well with  beginners who know nothing and  need to
#   acquire basic skills before  they can understand more complex topics.  It is
#   used in everything from martial arts, music and  even basic math and reading
#   skills.
#   This  book instructs you in Ruby by  slowly building and establishing skills
#   through techniques such as practice  and memorization, then applying them to
#   increasingly  difficult problems.  By the end of the  book you will have the
#   tools needed to  begin learning more complex  programming topics.  I like to
#   tell people that my book gives you your "programming black belt".  What this
#   means is that you know the basics well  enough to now start learning progra-
#   mming.
# 
#   The Hard Way is Easier
#   ----------------------
#   With the help of this book, you'll do the incredibly simple  things that all
#   programmers do to learn a programming language:
#
#               [1] Go through each exercise.
#               [2] Type in each file exactly.
#               [3] Make it run.
#
#   If you go through this  book and do  each exercise for   one or two  hours a
#   night, you will have a good  foundation for moving on to  another book about
#   Ruby to continue your studies. This book will not turn you into a programmer
#   overnight, but it will get you started on the path to learning how to code.
#   This book's job is to teach you the  three most essential skills that a beg-
#   ginning programmer needs to know:
#
#               [1] Reading and Writing
#               [2] Attention to Detail
#               [3] Spotting Differences
#
#   [1] Reading and Writing
#   -----------------------
#   If you have a problem typing, you will have a problem  learning to code, and
#   especially if you have a problem  typing the fairly odd characters in source
#   code. Without this simple skill you'll be unable to learn even  the most ba-
#   sic things about how software works. 
#   Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn  the na-
#   mes of the  symbols, get familiar  with typing them, and get you reading the
#   language.
#
#   [2] Attention to Detail
#   -----------------------
#   The one skill that separates bad programmers from good programmers is atten-
#   tion to detail.  In fact, it is what separates the good from  the bad in any
#   profession. You must  pay attention to the  tiniest  details of your work or
#   you will miss important elements of what you create. In programming, this is
#   how you end up with bugs and difficult-to-use systems.
#   By going through this book, and copying each example exactly,you'll be trai-
#   ning your brain to focus on the details of what you are doing, as you're do-
#   ing it.
#
#   [3] Spotting Differences
#   ------------------------
#   A very important skill (that most programmers develop over time) is the abi-
#   lity to visually notice differences between things.  An experienced program-
#   mer can take two pieces of code that are  slightly different and immediately
#   start pointing out the differences.  Programmers have invented tools to make
#   this even easier, but we won't be using any of these.You first have to train
#   your brain the hard way, then use the tools.
#   While you do these exercises,typing each one in,you will be making mistakes.
#   It's inevitable; even seasoned programmers would make a few.  Your job is to
#   compare what you've written to what is required and fix all the differences.
#   By doing so, you'll  train yourself to notice mistakes, bugs, and other pro-
#   blems.
#
#
#   Do Not Copy-Paste
#   -----------------
#   You must type each of these exercises in, manually.  If you copy  and paste,
#   you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train
#   your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code.
#   If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the
#   lessons.
#
#   A Note on Practice and Persistence
#   ----------------------------------
#   While you are studying programming, I am studying how to play the guitar.  I
#   practice it every day for at  least two hours  a day. I play scales, chords, 
#   and arpeggios for an hour and  then learn music theory, ear training, songs,
#   and anything else I can.  Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours
#   because I feel like it and it's fun.To me repetitive practice is natural and
#   just how to learn something. I know that to get good at anything you have to
#   practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it is diffi-
#   cult. Keep trying, and eventually it'll be easier and fun.
#
#   Between the time that I wrote  "Learn Python the Hard Way"  and  "Learn Ruby
#   the Hard Way" I discovered drawing and painting.  I fell in love with making
#   visual art at the age of 39 and have been  spending every day studying it in
#   much the same way that I sutdied guitar, music, and programming. I collected
#   books of instructional  material, did what the book said, painted every day,
#   and focused on enjoying the process of learning. I'm by no means an "artist"
#   or even that good, but I can now say that I can draw and paint. The same me-
#   thod I'm teaching you in this book applied to may adventures in art. 
#   
#   If you break the problem down into small exercises  and lessons, and do them
#   every day, you can learn to do almost anything.If you focus on slowly impro-
#   ving and enjoying the learning process,  then you will benefit no matter how
#   good you are at it.
#
#   As you study this book,and continue with programming, remember that anything
#   worth doing is difficult  at first.  Maybe you are the kind of person who is
#   affraid of failure, so you  give up at the first  sign of difficulty.  Maybe
#   you never learned self-discipline, so you can't do anything that's "boring".
#   Maybe you were  told that you  are "gifted", so  you never  attempt anything 
#   that might  make you seem stupid or not a prodigy. Maybe you are competitive
#   and unfairly compare yourself to someone like me who's been  programming for
#   more than 20 years.
#
#   Whatever your reason for wanting to quit, keep at it. Force yourself. If you
#   run into a Sutdy Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand,
#   then skip it and come back to it later.Just keep going because with program-
#   ming there's this very odd thing that happens. At first, you will not under-
#   stand anything. It'll be weird, just like  with learning any human language.
#   You will struggle with words and not know what symbols are what, and it will
#   all be very confusing. The one day BANG --your  brain will snap and you will
#   suddenly "get it". If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to under-
#   stand them, you will get it.  You might not  be a master coder, but you will
#   at least understand how programming works.
#
#   If you give up, you won't ever reach this point. You will hit the first con-
#   fusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep try-
#   ing, keep typing it in, keep trying to understand it and reading about it,
#   you will eventually get it. 
#
#   If you go through this whole book, and you  still do not  understand  how to
#   code, at least you have it a shot.You can say you tried your best and a lit-
#   tle more, and it didn't wourk out,  but at least you tried. You can be proud
#   of that.
