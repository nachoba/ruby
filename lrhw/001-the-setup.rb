#   LEARN RUBY THE HARD WAY - 3 EDITION
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Exercise 0: The Setup
#   ---------------------
#   Periodically in the book I will tell you to run "irb" or "the ruby shell" to
#   do some calculations.To run "irb" simply type "irb" in your terminal and hit
#   enter like you would with any other command.
#   To get out of "irb" simply type "quit" or "exit".
#
#   Finding Things on the Internet
#   ------------------------------
#   A major part of this book is learning to research programming topics online.
#   I'll tell you to "search for this on the internet", and your job is to use a
#   search engine to find the answer.
#   The reason I have you search instead of just giving you the answer is becau-
#   se I want you to be an  independent learner who  does not need  my book when 
#   you are done with it.
