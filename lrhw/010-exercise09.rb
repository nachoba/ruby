#  LEARN RUBY THE HARD WAY - 3 EDITION
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Exercise 9 : Printing, Printing, Printing
#  -----------------------------------------
#  By now you should realize the pattern  for this book is to use  more than one
#  exercise to teach you something new. I start with code that you might not un-
#  derstand, then more exercises explain  the concept.  If you do not understand
#  something now, you will later as you complete more exercises. Write down what
#  you don't understand, and keep going:

#  Here is some new strange stuff:
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

puts %q{
	There's something going on here.
	With this weird quote
	We'll be able to type as much as we like.
	Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
