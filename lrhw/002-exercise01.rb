#   LEARN RUBY THE HARD WAY - 3 EDITION
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Exercise 1 : A Good First Program
#   ---------------------------------
#   Type the following text into a single file. Ruby files end with .rb

puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'

#   So to run this program type:
#
#   $ ruby 002-exercise01.rb
#
#   The ouput of the program is:
#
#   Hello World!
#   Hello Again
#   I like typing this.
#   This is fun.
#   Yay! Printing.
#   I'd much rather you 'not'.
#   I "said" do not touch this.   
#
#
#   Study Drills
#   ------------
#   The study drills contain  things you should try to do. If you can't, skip it
#   and come back later. For this exercise, try this things:
#
#   [1] Make your script print another line.
#   [2] Make your script print only one of the lines.
#   [3] Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line.  What did  it
#       do? Try to find out what this character does.
#
#   From now on,  I won't explain how each exercise works  unless an exercise is
#   different.
